# WP Admin Design System

WP Admin Design System comes from the fantastic work done by [[10up](https://github.com/10up/SketchPress)]

What we have done is a general improvement in order to be more aligned with the current WordPress version, more flexible, easier to maintain and to integrate it into our daily workflow.

Our goal is to maintain a Sketch library and a collection of related pages for quickly creating awesome WordPress Admin interface mockups and designs.

MotorK has created a single library of WordPress Admin mockups (including a beta version of the new Gutenberg Editor) which cover the breadth of WordPress‚Äô authoring and administrative environment (wp-admin). Being able to start from this solid foundation allows us to focus more on the concepts and less on pushing the pixels to make it look like an authentic backend experience.

## Sketch App

The Sketch App, a digital design tool for Mac users, is increasingly popular among designers and developers in the digital world. Its a powerful tool that allows you to rapidly create mockups that can be high or low fidelity. What makes it even more useful is in its reproducible libraries and symbols.

If you haven‚Äôt worked with Sketch app before, we highly recommend going to their learning resources center to watch and read materials about it:¬†[https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/](https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/)
